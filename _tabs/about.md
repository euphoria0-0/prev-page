# Suyeong Park
### About me

My name is Suyeong Park (박수영; Su-yeong). I'm a alumni from UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology) and UoS (University of Seoul). I studied Machine Learning and Statistics.


### Principles
I'm enthusiatstic to solve various problems around us using information of data, representation of machanisms using ML, and knowledge of human-beings. 
I believe that AI and human should interact to solve some problems, not AI algorithms only.
We should note the role of AI and would use that toward better worlds, hopefully.

### Research Interests
I've focused on 'what information we need between exploration and exploitation' which is called active learning in machine learning field. 
To slove this question, I've studied Bayesian approach for uncertainty estimation. 
Currently, I want to focus on 'understanding an intrinsic attributes better using human-beings knowledge' is crucial for deploying our machine learning models in a real-world for better human-beings life. 
I believe it’s the key factor for better AI and can be achieved by understanding causality of things.
